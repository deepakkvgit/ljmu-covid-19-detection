Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases are increasing exponentially all over the world. The health care systems are facing a severe shortage of antigen test kits also known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test kits for the detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Co V-2). According to a study in China, the antigen test kits may generate as much as 30% false-negative results of the time (NS Medical Devices, 2020), leaving a lot of patients undetected. Detection of Covid-19 using Chest X-Ray or computed tomography (CT) scans can help in the early identification of patients and quarantine them while awaiting the results from the PCR tests. We can also use these solutions to identify the false negatives in PCR tests. Several artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions have been created to detect Covid-19 from Chest X-Ray images using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). This code is developed as part of completion of my masters in AI and machine learning from Liver Pool John Moores University. In this paper, we propose an Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN) model and a DCNN based model that can find Covid-19 from Chest X-Ray.
